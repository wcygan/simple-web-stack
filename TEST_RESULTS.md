# Simple Web Stack - Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-06-06

### Services Status
- ✅ Frontend: Running on http://localhost:8000
- ✅ Backend: Running on http://localhost:3000  
- ✅ MySQL: Running on port 3306

### Feature Testing Results

#### 1. Pagination (Stream A) ✅
```bash
# Basic pagination working
curl -s http://localhost:3000/tasks
```
- Returns paginated response with proper metadata
- Supports page, page_size parameters
- Total items and pages calculated correctly

#### 2. Frontend Integration (Stream B) ✅
- API proxy working: `/api/tasks` → backend
- Pagination types properly defined
- TodoApp component handles paginated responses

#### 3. Authentication (Stream C) ⚠️
- Database schema created (users, sessions tables)
- Auth endpoints exist (/auth/register, /auth/login)
- Issue: UUID format mismatch prevents full testing
- Workaround: Created default user for testing

#### 4. Search & Filtering (Stream D) ✅
- Backend supports search parameters
- Frontend has SearchForm component
- Query parameters: `q` (search) and `status` (filter)

#### 5. Hot Reloading ✅
- Docker Compose override working
- Backend uses cargo-watch
- Frontend has volume mounts
- Changes reflect without rebuilding containers

### API Test Examples

#### Create Task
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Test task"}'
```

#### List Tasks with Pagination
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/tasks
```

#### Frontend API Proxy
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/tasks
```

### Sample Data Created
1. Test task from API
2. Complete documentation  
3. Write unit tests
4. Review pull requests

### Known Issues
1. **UUID Format**: Backend expects text UUIDs but tries to decode as binary
2. **Auth Routes**: LoginForm and RegisterForm islands exist but not fully integrated
3. **User Association**: Tasks require user_id due to foreign key constraint

### Summary
The core features from streams A-D have been successfully implemented:
- ✅ Pagination working end-to-end
- ✅ Search/filter infrastructure in place
- ✅ Hot reloading configured
- ⚠️ Authentication needs UUID format fix
- ✅ All services running and communicating properly

The application is functional with pagination, search capabilities, and development hot-reloading enabled.
